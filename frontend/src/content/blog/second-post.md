Healthcare software handles sensitive patient data, supports clinical decisions, and often runs continuously for years. Bugs are not just inconvenient—they can be dangerous. In resource-constrained environments, such as many parts of Africa, efficiency and reliability are paramount. Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance and safety, is increasingly being adopted in healthcare software development across the continent.

- Memory Safety (bugs can harm patients)
- Longevity (software used for decades)
- Performance (large datasets, real-time systems)
- Low resource Environments
- Growing Ecosystem
- Community Support
