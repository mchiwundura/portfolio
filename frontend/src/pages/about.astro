    <h2>From Pharmacy to Code</h2>
    <p>
      I spent years studying how drugs work in the body. Now I'm learning how to build 
      software that helps healthcare work better.

    <h3>The Journey</h3>
    
    <div class="journey-step">

      <h4>Bachelor of Pharmacy (2019-2023)</h4>
<p>
  I studied Pharmacy at Rhodes University in Grahamstown (now Makhanda), completing my Bachelor 
  of Pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic and graduating in record time despite the disruption. 
  While building a strong foundation in pharmacology, therapeutics, and clinical sciences, I also 
  developed a growing interest in technology. In my second year, I began teaching myself to code, 
  starting with Python and later learning Django and basic machine learning through structured 
  tutorials. What began as curiosity quickly became a serious parallel track—using code to model 
  problems, automate workflows, and explore how software could extend the impact of healthcare 
  beyond traditional settings.

      <h4>Teaching & Discovery (2019-2024)</h4>
<p>
  Alongside my pharmacy studies, I spent several years tutoring Grade 12 Science students, 
  developing an early appreciation for how people learn—and where traditional methods fall short. 
  During my master’s degree, this expanded into tutoring undergraduate pharmacy students, where I 
  gained experience in structured teaching, mentoring, and academic presentation. A highlight of 
  this period was becoming a finalist in the Three Minute Thesis (3MT) competition, which sharpened 
  my ability to communicate complex scientific ideas clearly and concisely. Teaching reinforced my 
  interest in building better learning systems, not just delivering content.
</p>

    <div class="journey-step">
      <h4>Research & Realization (2023-2024)</h4>
      <p>
        Completed my MSc in Pharmacology with a computational focus. Worked with cells, 
        ran statistical models, and discovered I loved the modeling more than the lab work. 
        Applied to a pharmacometrics PhD program and didn't get in—but the application 
        process taught me I wanted to build tools, not just publish papers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="journey-step">
      <h4>Transition & Focus (2024-Present)</h4>
<p>
  After completing my master’s degree, I became increasingly focused on proving my technical 
  ability through execution. I doubled down on software development—working with Python, React, 
  data structures, and applied modeling—while refining how I approach projects. Rather than chasing 
  breadth, I began prioritizing depth, clarity, and shipping. This period marked a shift from 
  exploration to intention: building real tools at the intersection of healthcare, data, and 
  education.

  <div class="why-this-matters">
    <h3>Why This Combination Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Most developers don't understand clinical workflows. Most pharmacists don't code. 
      I'm betting that sitting in the middle of that Venn diagram is valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what vancomycin does to kidneys AND what recursion does to stack frames. 
      I can explain enzyme kinetics and event loops. I understand both the problem space 
      (healthcare) and increasingly, the solution space (software).

    <h3>What I'm Working Toward</h3>
    <p>
      I'm aiming for a remote health data scientist role, building 
      products that solve real healthcare problems, and learning to finish what I start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently doing my pharmacy internship in Zimbabwe while building my portfolio—proving 
      I can execute, not just theorize.

  <div class="beyond-code">
    <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
<p>
  Beyond software and science, I work across design, storytelling, and 3D. I’m developing 
  <em>Mwene</em>, a narrative-driven project that spans a web-based comic and an experimental game 
  built with Godot, combining world-building, visual design, and interactive systems. I also work 
  with 3D tools, video, and visual assets—skills that inform how I think about user experience, 
  clarity, and engagement.
</p>
<p>
  These projects aren’t side distractions; they’re part of a continuous process of improving how 
  I design, communicate, and ship ideas. I care deeply about craft—and about getting better with 
  every iteration.
</p>

  </div>

  <div class="values">
    <h3>What Guides Me</h3>
    <p>
      Faith matters to me—I try to praise God in the work I do and how I treat people. 
      Health matters—I exercise regularly and sleep well because code written at 2am is 
      usually garbage. People matter—I'm learning to be present for family and friends 
      instead of always grinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finishing what I start matters most right now. I have degrees, I have skills, 
      I have ideas. What I'm building is the discipline to actually ship things people can use.

    <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
<p>
  I’m open to conversations with pharmacists and scientists moving into tech, teams building 
  healthcare or education software, and anyone interested in applied data, modeling, or learning 
  systems. I’m especially interested in roles and collaborations that value domain knowledge as 
  much as technical execution.
</p>
<p>
  Based in Zimbabwe and open to remote opportunities, collaborations, and thoughtful conversations.
