    <h2>From Pharmacy to Code</h2>
    <p>
      I spent years studying how drugs work in the body. Now I'm learning how to build 
      software that helps healthcare work better.

    <h3>The Journey</h3>
    
    <div class="journey-step">
      <!-- Optional: Icon or small illustration -->
      <h4>Teaching & Discovery (2019-2024)</h4>
      <p>
        Spent 5 years tutoring pharmacy students and saw firsthand how technology could 
        improve learning. Students struggled with disorganized materials and passive study 
        methods. I started organizing my notes in markdown and building better systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="journey-step">
      <h4>Research & Realization (2023-2024)</h4>
      <p>
        Completed my MSc in Pharmacology with a computational focus. Worked with cells, 
        ran statistical models, and discovered I loved the modeling more than the lab work. 
        Applied to a pharmacometrics PhD program and didn't get in—but the application 
        process taught me I wanted to build tools, not just publish papers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="journey-step">
      <h4>Transition & Focus (2024-Present)</h4>
      <p>
        Realized dispensing wasn't for me. Started learning to code seriously—React, Python, 
        data structures. Had 12 unfinished projects at one point (we don't talk about that). 
        Now focusing on actually shipping: building Fundeka for students, learning health 
        data science, and proving that pharmacists can write code.

  <div class="why-this-matters">
    <h3>Why This Combination Matters</h3>
    <p>
      Most developers don't understand clinical workflows. Most pharmacists don't code. 
      I'm betting that sitting in the middle of that Venn diagram is valuable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know what vancomycin does to kidneys AND what recursion does to stack frames. 
      I can explain enzyme kinetics and event loops. I understand both the problem space 
      (healthcare) and increasingly, the solution space (software).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="current-focus">
    <h3>What I'm Working Toward</h3>
    <p>
      I'm aiming for a remote health data scientist role ($100k+ by 2027-2028), building 
      products that solve real healthcare problems, and learning to finish what I start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently doing my pharmacy internship in Zimbabwe while building my portfolio—proving 
      I can execute, not just theorize.

  <div class="beyond-code">
    <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding or dispensing medications, I'm making a wind spider game on Sundays 
      (because why not?), working on my fitness, and staying connected with family and friends. 
      I've learned the hard way that burning out doesn't make you productive—it just makes you 
      miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm also working on being okay with "good enough" instead of chasing "world-class" at 
      everything. Turns out, shipping one thing beats starting twelve things. Who knew?
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="values">
    <h3>What Guides Me</h3>
    <p>
      Faith matters to me—I try to praise God in the work I do and how I treat people. 
      Health matters—I exercise regularly and sleep well because code written at 2am is 
      usually garbage. People matter—I'm learning to be present for family and friends 
      instead of always grinding.
    </p>
    <p>
      And finishing what I start matters most right now. I have degrees, I have skills, 
      I have ideas. What I'm building is the discipline to actually ship things people can use.

    <h3>Let's Connect</h3>
    <p>
      I'm open to conversations with other pharmacists learning to code, health tech folks 
      who need someone who understands both clinical and technical sides, and anyone who 
      wants to talk about educational technology or health data science.
